## Development Guidelines

### Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex UI from simple components
3. **Props Interface**: Clear, typed props with defaults where appropriate
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at component level

### State Management Strategy

- **Local State**: Component-specific state with useState
- **Shared State**: Cross-component state with useContext
- **Server State**: API data management with custom hooks
- **Form State**: Controlled components with validation

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no any types
- **ESLint**: Airbnb config with custom rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing

This comprehensive requirements document provides a detailed roadmap for building a modern, accessible, and performant media simulation analysis dashboard using React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components.
